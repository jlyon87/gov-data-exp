# gov-data-exp

Thought I'd try a few things with the NASA/FBI APIs. Turns out the current gov't shutdown includes shutting down APIs. Too bad there is no HTTP Status Code for that? I only get an ECONNREFUSED system error.

## APIs

[FBI Crime Data](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api)

[NASA Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/)
